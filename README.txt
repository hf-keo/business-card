# Business Card â€” Icons + Custom Fonts

- Inline SVG icons are used for Phone, Mail, Globe, and Location (vector, crisp at any size).
- Colors:
  - Blue: #003298
  - Green: #71b400
- Google Font 'Poppins' is included. To change, replace the <link> tag in <head>.
- If you want to self-host fonts, put your .woff2 in /fonts and use the @font-face block at the bottom of index.html (uncomment it).

Upload `index.html` and `logo.png` to your GitHub repo root.
